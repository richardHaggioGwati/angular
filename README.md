## Introduction

Angular is a popular front-end framework developed by Google for building dynamic web applications. It's based on
TypeScript and provides a robust set of tools and features for building modern web applications.

## Getting Started

- Install Angular CLI:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli

- Create a new Angular project:
    ```bash
    ng new my-angular-app

- Run your application:
    ```bash
  cd my-angular-app
  ng serve

## Components

Angular applications are built using components. Components are the basic building blocks of an Angular app and consist
of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and CSS styles.

Learn about [Angular Components](https://angular.io/guide/component-overview).

## Templates

Templates define the user interface of an Angular component. They use HTML and Angular-specific syntax to display data
and interact with components.

Learn about [Angular Templates](https://angular.io/api/core/ng-template).

## Directives

Directives in Angular are special markers on DOM elements that tell Angular to do something with that element or its
children. Common directives include ngIf, ngFor, and ngClass.

Learn about [Angular Directives](https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives).

## Services

Services are used to encapsulate logic that isn't directly tied to a specific component. They provide a way to share
data and functionality across different parts of your application.

Learn about [Angular Services](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes/toh-pt4).

## Routing

Angular provides a powerful router for building single-page applications. You can define routes, route parameters, and
navigate between different views.

Learn about [Angular Routing](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes/toh-pt5).

## Forms

Angular offers a robust form handling mechanism, allowing you to build complex forms with two-way data binding,
validation, and form submission.

Learn about [Angular Forms](https://angular.io/guide/forms-overview).

## HTTP Client

Angular provides an HTTP client for making API requests and handling responses. You can perform GET, POST, PUT, and
DELETE operations with ease.

Learn about [Angular HTTP Client](https://angular.io/guide/understanding-communicating-with-http).

## Dependency Injection

Angular uses dependency injection to provide instances of services to components when they are requested. Understanding
dependency injection is essential for building scalable and maintainable applications.

Learn about [Dependency Injection in Angular](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-overview).

## Testing

Angular provides tools and libraries for writing unit tests and end-to-end (e2e) tests for your application. Testing is
crucial for ensuring the reliability of your code.

Learn about [Testing in Angular](https://angular.io/guide/testing-components-basics).
